# Welcome to CCP CompMedChem

## CCP CMC
CCP CompMedChem - a CCP for in silico small molecule compound design. Built up of academic method developers, industrial CADD groups and software providers. Aimed at providing a route-to-use for computational methods, a portal for naive users to find best practice and ensuring novel methods are focussed on industrially relevant problems.

#### Purpose:
1. Naive user access to comp-chem best-practice and tools
2. Academic route-to-market for tools and technologies
3. Novel method development that speaks to the needs of pharma


#### Headline Outcomes:
1. Two workshops held (Diamond and Cambridge and attended by over 20 people (details below)
2. Â£1.3 M grant proposal submitted (hear back next week)
3. [Open-sourcing](https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/squonk){:target="_blank"} of the [SQUONK platform](https://squonk.it/) and introduction of third party tools commitment to continue to do so
4. Third meeting being organised for October and training workshop to be held this year
