# Welcome to CCP CompMedChem

## CCP CMC
CCP CompMedChem - a CCP for in silico small molecule compound design. Built up of academic method developers, industrial CADD groups and software providers. Aimed at providing a route-to-use for computational methods, a portal for naive users to find best practice and ensuring novel methods are focussed on industrially relevant problems.

#### Purpose:
1. Naive user access to comp-chem best-practice and tools
2. Academic route-to-market for tools and technologies
3. Novel method development that speaks to the needs of pharma


#### Headline Outcomes:
1. Two workshops held Diamond and Cambridge and attended by over 20 people (details below)
2. Contributor to [open-source](https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/squonk){:target="_blank"} community surrounding [SQUONK platform](https://squonk.it/){:target="_blank"}. Including introduction of third party tools and commitment to continue to do so
3. Third meeting being organised for October and training workshop to be held this year
